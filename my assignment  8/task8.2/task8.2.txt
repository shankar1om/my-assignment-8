1.difference between relative and absolute positioning in css:
  >css position-relative:
   ..when we give any element relative position it  behaves same as static.
   ..but when we apply its property (like: top ,bottom,left, right) by giving 
     some value it  displaces with respect to its normal original place not with respect to its 
     parent or viewport.
   ..after displacing the element the gap is created which not filled by neighbour 
     elements.
   ..when we displace element in relative positioning it displace it self relative
     to its normal original position without disturbing other elements.
   ..other space proprties like height ,width ,padding ,margin will disturb neighbour
     elements.
     
   >css position absolute:
    ..when we give any element absolute position it goes out of normal flow of document.
    ..remove from normal flow can overlap the element.
    ..when we apply its property (like: top ,bottom,left, right) by giving 
      some value it  displaces from its place with respect to its nearest parent.
    ..nearest positioning should be relative otherwise it will consider the whole body 
      as its relative parent.
    ..after displacing the element the gap is created which is filled by its neighbour 
      elements.
