1.z-index:

>..The z-index property in CSS controls which element should appear on the screen when more than one are vertically 
overlaping each other.

 ..the element having higher the z-index gets higher priority to appear on the screen.
 ..syntax: z-index: auto (by default);
                   :number(can also be negative);
                   :initial;
                   :inherit;

    explanation about example:

 ..in the example  i have shown that by default ramanujan picture was being shown on the top
  but when we gave Dr.ramanujan picture lowest z-index value and Dr. A.P.J Abdul kalam picture highest z-index
  value than scenerio gets reverse. now Dr. A.P.J Abdul kalam picture is coming on top (visible on the screen) 
  and Dr.ramanujan picture is coming on the the last from the top (now not visible).
